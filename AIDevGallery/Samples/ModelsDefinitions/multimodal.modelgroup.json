        "Description": "Phi-3 Vision is a lightweight, state-of-the-art open multimodal model built upon datasets that include synthetic data and filtered publicly available web data with a focus on very high-quality, reasoning dense data both on text and vision. The model belongs to the Phi-3 model family, and the multimodal version supports up to 128K context length (in tokens). The base model has undergone a rigorous enhancement process, incorporating both supervised fine-tuning and direct preference optimization, to ensure precise instruction adherence and robust safety measures.",
