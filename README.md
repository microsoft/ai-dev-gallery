## üöÄ Getting started
Download [AI Dev Gallery from the Microsoft Store](http://aka.ms/ai-dev-gallery-store) or follow these steps to install it manually:

### 1. Set up the environment

>**‚ö†Ô∏è Note**: AI Dev Gallery requires [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/) or later for building and Windows 10 or newer to run.
If you're new to building apps with WinUI and the Windows App SDK, follow the [installation instructions](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/apps/get-started/start-here).

**Required [Visual Studio components](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/apps/get-started/start-here?tabs=vs-2022-17-10#required-workloads-and-components):**
- Windows application development

### 2. Clone the repository

```shell
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/AI-Dev-Gallery.git
```

### 3. Open AIDevGallery.sln with Visual Studio!

Ensure that the `AIDevGallery` project is set as the startup project in Visual Studio.

## ‚ùì FAQs
- **Q: Is a Microsoft account necessary to use the app?**
  - **A:** No, the app does NOT require a Microsoft account for use.
- **Q: Can I use the app without an internet connection?**
  - **A:** Yes, the app works offline since the AI models are downloaded locally. However, you will need to be online to download additional AI models from Hugging Face or GitHub.
- **Q: What AI models are available in the app?**
  - **A:** The app features popular open source models and APIs from the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/ai/overview">Windows AI  Foundry</a>. When executing a sample, you can select which model you want to use.
- **Q: Is the app's source code accessible? Can I contribute new samples?**
  - **A:** Yes, the app is completely open-source, and its code is accessible on [GitHub](https://github.com/microsoft/AI-Dev-Gallery). Feel free to contribute by <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/AI-Dev-Gallery/issues">filing an issue</a>, or submitting a PR and one of our moderators will review it.
- **Q: Where can I provide feedback?**
  - **A:** Feel free to give us feedback or [open an issue](https://github.com/microsoft/AI-Dev-Gallery/issues/new) on our GitHub repository.
- **Q: Do I need to run the app just to try a single sample?**
  - **A:** Yes, the app is required to run any sample. However, once you've downloaded a model for a sample via the app, you can export the sample as a Visual Studio project and run it independently from there.
